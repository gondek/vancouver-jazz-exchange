## How Our Meetups Work

After a round of introductions, we'll go around in a circle and listen to everyone's recommendations on our headphones. After everyone has shared, we can further discuss jazz or other common interests. Sometimes meetups are followed by a live jazz concert nearby. _Check the event details if venue-specific reservations are required._

## Attending a Meetup

1. Find an upcoming meetup date on our [Meetup.com]({{ site.meetupcom }}) page.
2. Choose a song, album, or artist to present. If choosing an album or artist, select one song or prepare a short sampler. If we have a full group, we ask that each track or sample be cut to a limit of 5 minutes so we have a chance to discuss everyone's suggestions.
3. Pack some headphones for the meetup. If you have standard 3.5mm minijack corded headphones, you can plug them into our splitter so we can synchronize our listening to one device. If you have wireless headphones, please bring your own device on which you can stream people's suggestions.
4. Grab your device, headphones, and join us!
5. At the end of the meetup, your host will gather all the recommendations and post them to this website. Please let us know if you would like your recommendation to be anonymous, or be posted with your initials, partial name, or full name.
