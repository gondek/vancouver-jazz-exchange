## How Our Meetups Work

After some introductions, each person shares a track and the story behind it. To listen together, please bring headphones/earbuds and a smartphone (or other device) that can stream music. A 6-way audio splitter (for the standard 3.5mm headphone jack) is available for those without phone data or unable to stream the track.

After everyone has shared, we will see where the conversation takes us! More jazz? Sharing our other hobbies and interests? It's all good!

Sometimes meetups are followed by a live jazz concert nearby. _Note: Check the event details if venue-specific reservations are required._

## Attending a Meetup

1. Find an upcoming meetup date on our [Eventbrite]({{ site.eventbrite }}) page.
2. Choose a song, album, or artist to present to the group. If choosing an album or artist, select one of their songs or prepare a short sampler.
3. Verify the song is available on Spotify. If it isn't, or if you've prepared a sample mix, please send a copy to the meetup host.
4. Grab your device, headphones, and join us!
5. At the end of the meetup, your host will gather all the recommendations and post them to this website.

## Additional Notes
- For meetings with a lot of attendees, we may limit how long we listen to each sample so everyone has a chance to share their contribution.
- Please let the host know if you're comfortable having your initials, partial name, or full name associated with your recommendation when it gets posted to this website. Anonymous recommendations are fine too!
