**Location**: VPL Central Branch

**Recommendations:**

- Victoria discussed her interests in vocal jazz styles and introduced singer Catherine Russell. We listened to two Russell tracks, "Alone Together" and "Blue and Sentimental".
- Chris Wong discussed Ethio-jazz (which tied in to the recent [Infidels Jazz Presents: Africa! at Fox Cabaret](https://theinfidelsjazz.ca/event/africa-at-the-fox-cabaret/) concert). We listened to Mulatu Astatke's "Yègellé Tezeta".
- Alex Gondek shared Duke Ellington's "Kinda Dukish / Rockin' in Rhythm" from "The Great Paris Concert" (other renditions appear on several other recordings).

Other topics that came up: The culture and jazz writer Ted Gioia's [Substack](https://www.honest-broker.com/), the jazz singer Tierney Sutton (we listened to her cover of "Haunted Heart"), the late jazz singer Shannon Gunn's posthumously released "On a Mountain" album, and the upcoming [Jazz at the Bolt Festival](https://www.jazzatthebolt.com/).
